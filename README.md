Sure, here's a revised version of the README:

# Super Simple Cross-Chain Webhookifier

## Run:

### Local Environment
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the webhook server:
   ```bash
   node webhook.js
   ```
3. Expose the local server to the internet:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

### Crossmint Setup
1. Create a new collection.
2. Set up webhooks in the Crossmint console, using the `/webhook` path.

### Blockchain Configuration
1. Update the `.env` file with your private key and `sha256`.

## Considerations
1. **Wallet Address**: We mint to the `walletAddress` specified in the webhook. Custodial users might face issues exporting tokens.
2. **Error Handling**: Proper handlers are not set up here. Ensure robust handling and reliability are implemented.
3. **Webhook Downtime**: If the webhook goes down during purchases, manual backfill from Crossmint's end will be necessary.
4. **Escrow**: Escrow should be disabled.

## Additional Information
I have included a Solidity file that can be deployed and used for testing purposes.
